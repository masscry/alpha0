# Introduction

Hello, $username$! This project consists of several small homemade C structures, which I have written in past years and
used from time to time. I am glad, that this repository can be somehow helpful for you.

The idea of this project is to provide some useful structures without external dependencies, so if you have some neat ideas,
code or found any bugs while using project, I'll be glad to add your contribution to this project, if it won't break anything.
